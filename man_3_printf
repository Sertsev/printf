.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function produces output according to format. The output is written to the stdout, the standard output stream. It writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments(accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg) are converted to output
.PP
.B Return value
.PP
On success the function returns the number of characters printed excluding the null byte.
On error then a negative value is returned.
.PP
.B Format of the string
.PP
Each format specification is introduced by the character % and ends with a conversion specifier. The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier and hence are used in the order given where each specifier asks for the next argument. 
An error might occur if unsufficient arguments are given.
.PP
.B The conversion specifier
.PP
A character that specifies the type of convertion to be applied.
The vaious conversion specifiers are as follows:-

.B d, i

Handles signed or unsigned integers

.B c

The int argument is converted to an unsigned char and the resulting character is written.

.B s

The const char * argument is expected to be of a character pointer ie pointer to a string. The characters from the string are written excluding the null byte terminator

.B %

No argument is converted. The complete version of %% is written.
